The right voice and tone sets the basic principles for effective communication with our users.

## Voice

Voice is how we communicate with our users across our brand, marketing materials and company
products. Our voice is human. It is familiar, friendly and clear. Our priority is to explain our
products and to help our users get their work done.

### Voice principles

<div class="d-flex row flex-wrap">
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3 p-b-40 p-t-24 p-l-32 p-r-32">
    <div class="c8y-svgicon m-b-16" style="font-size: 80px; line-height: 1;">
      <i c8yIcon="female" class="text-primary"></i>
    </div>
    <h4 class="card-title ">We are humans</h3>
  </div>  
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3 p-b-40 p-t-24 p-l-32 p-r-32">
    <div class="c8y-svgicon m-b-16" style="font-size: 80px; line-height: 1;">
      <i c8yIcon="users" class="text-primary"></i>
    </div>
    <h4 class="card-title ">We are friendly</h3>
  </div>  
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3 p-b-40 p-t-24 p-l-32 p-r-32">
    <div class="c8y-svgicon m-b-16" style="font-size: 80px; line-height: 1;">
      <i c8yIcon="appointment-scheduling" class="text-primary"></i>
    </div>
    <h4 class="card-title ">We are professional</h3>
  </div>  
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3 p-b-40 p-t-24 p-l-32 p-r-32">
    <div class="c8y-svgicon m-b-16" style="font-size: 80px; line-height: 1;">
      <i c8yIcon="complaint" class="text-primary"></i>
    </div>
    <h4 class="card-title ">We are clear</h3>
  </div>  
</div>  

## Tone

The tone might be seen as the subset of our voice communication. Our tone is professional yet
informal but above all clear.

When writing, consider the user's specific situation and task's context:

- Are they confused and seeking help on a specific issue?
- Are they overwhelmed with information in a particular place in the application and just need the
  most basic hints to accomplish some task?

Once you have an idea of the emotional state, you can adjust the tone accordingly to a specific
situation.

## How to communicate

### Write simple and be clear

Time is limited, people are usually in a rush. Keep your copywriting simple.

Our product can be very complex, so it is very important for us to make things clear, avoiding
confusion and saving time for our customers and support team.

<div class="c8y-example c8y-example-split-sm">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 p-r-sm-48">
      <h4 class="m-b-16">
        <span class="label label-danger" >Don't</span>
      </h4>
      <p><em>Click the button with the label <b>Device</b> on the uppermost right-hand side of the screen.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 p-l-sm-48">
      <h4 class="m-b-16">
        <span class="label label-success" >Do</span>
      </h4>
      <p><em>Click <b>Device</b> on the top right.</em></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Stay human

Our products are very professional and serious, but they are also made for and to communicate with humans.

Avoid making users feel like interacting with a lawyer or a robot.

As a general rule of thumb we recommend the following:

Do not write something that you would not say out loud. You can test it with a person next to you.

<div class="c8y-example c8y-example-split-sm">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 p-r-sm-48">
      <h4 class="m-b-16">
        <span class="label label-danger" >Don't</span>
      </h4>
      <p class="m-b-16"><em> "For verification purposes, an email will be sent to the email address you provided."</em></p>
      <p><em> "Error POST-409"</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 p-l-sm-48">
      <h4 class="m-b-16">
        <span class="label label-success" >Do</span>
      </h4>
      <p class="m-b-16"><em> "A verification email was sent to your email address."</em></p>
      <p><em> "Unable to install: An installation or network configuration task is currently in progress. Complete that task before proceeding."</em></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Be helpful

While we work every day to make it simpler and easier, Cumulocity is a big place. It might be easy
for people to get confused on some occasions. Always try to set the context on what is being done and
provide possible solutions if something went wrong.

<div class="c8y-example c8y-example-split-sm">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 p-r-sm-48">
      <h4 class="m-b-16">
        <span class="label label-danger" >Don't</span>
      </h4>
      <p class="m-b-16"><em>"Phone number is invalid"</em></p>
      <p><em>"You cannot change these settings as you don't have the right permission."</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 p-l-sm-48">
      <h4 class="m-b-16">
        <span class="label label-success" >Do</span>
      </h4>
      <p class="m-b-16"><em>"Phone number have to be 10 digits."</em></p>
      <p><em>"To change these settings, you need tenant management permission."</em></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Active and positive voice

The active voice describes a sentence where the subject performs the action stated by the verb. It
follows a clear "subject + verb + object" construct that is easy to read.

<div class="c8y-example c8y-example-split-sm">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 p-r-sm-48">
      <h4 class="m-b-16">
        <span class="label label-danger">Don't</span>
      </h4>
      <p class="m-b-16"><em>"The device might not be 'On'."</em></p>
      <p class="m-b-16"><em>"Please select the preferred version."</em></p>
      <p><em>"Check the alarms to get more details."</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 p-l-sm-48">
      <h4 class="m-b-16">
        <span class="label label-success" >Do</span>
      </h4>
      <p class="m-b-16"><em>"The device is 'Off'."</em></p>
      <p class="m-b-16"><em>"Please select a version."</em></p>
      <p><em>"Check the alarms for details."</em></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Avoid jargon

Our products and services can be very technical but that does not mean that all of our clients are
familiar with the technical lingo. Be detailed as you need but avoid technical terms. Explain a
particular task like you would to a 7-year-old, without being condescending.

### Write global

Even if you are writing in English, remember that our customers are global. It is important to do proper cultural
research to avoid problems without toning down your message.

### Use gender-neutral pronouns

Avoid using gender-specific, third-person pronouns such as "he", "she", "his", and "hers". Whenever possible, use the second person. When needed, use the gender-neutral pronoun "they."
