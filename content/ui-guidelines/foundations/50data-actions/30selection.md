Selection actions involve choosing, toggling, and filtering options.

Users can select from a list, toggle between choices, and apply filters to refine their view and
interact with specific data elements. These actions enhance usability and facilitate efficient data
navigation and manipulation.

## Selection actions on the action bar

The action bar, positioned at the top of the list of records, serves as a central control hub. It
provides filtering and display options on the left side and convenient buttons for common actions on
the right side.

This layout enhances the user experience by offering a well-organized and easily
accessible interface for efficient navigation and interaction with the records.

## Single selection

The single selection is used to select only one item from a given list.

Under the hood, single selection works like a radio button, but the context and the number of
options determine which component to use.
