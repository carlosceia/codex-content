The split view is ideal for working through a queue of items. It allows the user to stay on the same screen while
viewing and editing multiple items.

## Examples

Selecting a record from a list, displays the detail on the right-hand side.
<div class="c8y-example">
  <img src="../../../images/layouts/split-view.png" alt="Split view simulators" class="img-responsive m-b-24">
  <img src="../../../images/foundations/split-view-opcua.png" alt="Split view opcua" class="img-responsive">
</div>
