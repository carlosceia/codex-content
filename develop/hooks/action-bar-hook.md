The action bar offers a user-friendly interface to efficiently navigate and manage records. 

On the left, filtering and display components help refine the list. Dropdowns, checkboxes, search bar, and buttons allow users to filter by category, date, status, or other attributes.

On the right, handy buttons or dropdowns provide shortcuts for common tasks like adding records, refreshing data, deleting selections, exporting formats, and more.
